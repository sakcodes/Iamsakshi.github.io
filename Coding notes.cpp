Coding notes

1) When we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y, we mean that as
 the size of the input to the algorithm grows larger and larger, the running time of X 
will eventually become faster than the running time of Y. This is typically expressed using 
big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the worst-case running time of an algorithm.

Vectors ka reverse ka syntax reverse(arr.begin(), arr.end())
Array ko sort kar sakte hai sort (arr1[0], arr[n-1])
i1 = std::max_element(arr, arr + n);

max se 2 values ka max milta hai or  max_element se array ka max number without for loop 

jab bhi return karna toh curly brackets laga kar karna
